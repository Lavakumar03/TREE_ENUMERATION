# Tree Enumeration in Aerial Images

## Introduction
Tree Enumeration in Aerial Images is a project aimed at automating the process of counting trees in aerial photographs using computer vision techniques. The project utilizes image processing algorithms to identify and count individual trees within large-scale aerial imagery.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide a tool for efficiently and accurately quantifying the number of trees in a given area from aerial images. This can be valuable for various applications such as urban planning, forestry management, environmental monitoring, and ecological studies.

## Features
- **Tree Detection**: Utilizes object detection algorithms to locate and identify trees within aerial images.
- **Tree Counting**: Counts the number of individual trees detected in the image.
- **Accuracy Evaluation**: Includes methods for evaluating the accuracy of tree detection and counting.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale aerial images efficiently.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of the detected trees and their distribution within the image.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection
