# Tree Enumeration in Aerial Images

## Introduction
Tree Enumeration in Aerial Images is a project aimed at automating the process of counting trees in aerial photographs using computer vision techniques. The project utilizes image processing algorithms to identify and count individual trees within large-scale aerial imagery.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide a tool for efficiently and accurately quantifying the number of trees in a given area from aerial images. This can be valuable for various applications such as urban planning, forestry management, environmental monitoring, and ecological studies.

## Features
- **Tree Detection**: Utilizes object detection algorithms to locate and identify trees within aerial images.
- **Tree Counting**: Counts the number of individual trees detected in the image.
- **Accuracy Evaluation**: Includes methods for evaluating the accuracy of tree detection and counting.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale aerial images efficiently.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of the detected trees and their distribution within the image.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection

I tested the Predictions on the inference code by loading the saved .best.pt model file and testing it on the new images. The model predictions came out to be good as shown in the figures
